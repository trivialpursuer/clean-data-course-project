- Each row represents the average measurements of the features for a given subject and activity.
- Only mean and standard deviation measurement features were summarized.
- The script run_analysis.R is used to extract and clean the data. It does the following:
  1. Reads in the test and training data and merges both sets with the activities and subject files, then merges the two together.
  2. Extracts only those columns that measure a mean or standard deviation for that particular feature.
  3. Groups the data based on Subject and Activity and computes the mean of every measurement column, storing the results in a new data table.

Columns in DataSet

Activity - Identifier of Activity being performed
Subject - Identifier of individual Subject performing activity
